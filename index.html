    		<p class="para">Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.</p>

           <p class="para"> Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>

            <p class="para">Photography is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.</p>

            The camera is the image-forming device, and a photographic plate, photographic film or a silicon electronic image sensor is the capture medium. The respective recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.</p>

            <p class="para">Photographers control the camera and lens to "expose" the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a "latent image" (on plate or film) or RAW file (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image. Digital cameras use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.</p><br><br>

            Nearly all camera phones use CMOS image sensors, due to largely reduced power consumption compared to CCD type cameras, which are also used, but in few camera phones. Some of camera phones even use more expensive Back Side Illuminated CMOS which uses energy lesser than CMOS, although more expensive than CMOS and CCD.</p>

            <p class="para">As camera phone technology has progressed over the years, the lens design has evolved from a simple double Gauss or Cooke triplet to many molded plastic aspheric lens elements made with varying dispersion and refractive indexes. The latest generation of phone cameras also apply distortion (optics), vignetting, and various optical aberration corrections to the image before it is compressed into a .jpeg format.'</p><br><br>

              <p class="para">There are some Photography settings which a photographer should know about:</p>
              <p class="para">
              	<b>1-Black and white:</b> This is a standard feature in digital cameras and dSLR cameras. This color scheme does have a charm attached to it but it is often overused. It is always a best idea to take a color photograph and then convert it into grayscale on computer. You can increase contrast to improve detailing in grayscale images.</p>

                <p class="para"><b>2-Contrast:</b> Contrast increases the glowing element of a color in terms of its brightness. A high contrast in an image makes the subject in focus to stand out against a background or it brings into focus a wide array of subjects such as photo of a bazaar. The better the contrast, better are the details brought out.</p>

                <p class="para"><b>3-Tone:</b> The tone in an image sets the mood of the image. The tone could be warm or cool. A warm tone tends to be more redder with predominant colors red, yellow and orange. A cool tone tends to be bluer with soft and mellow colors. Warm tone is considered masculine where as cool tone is considered as feminine.</p>

               <p class="para"><b>4-Hue:</b> Some dSLR cameras have hue option, which shifts all colors by a certain degree. You can do this using an image editing software also. This feature can be used for dreamlike digital photography to match with the tone of the event.</p>
 
               <p class="para"><b>5-Sharpness:</b> It is also called as acutance. It is a measure of the sharpness with which a film can imitate the edge of an object. A greater sharpness gives a grainier image while a reduced sharpness gives a washed out appearance. Sharp images are appealing in close-ups whereas it looks odd in portraits.</p>

               <p class="para"><b>6-Sepia:</b> In olden photographs, a chemical was used to make the photographs last longer. This generates the sepia tone in photographs. Modern digital cameras and dSLRs have this feature readymade in them.</p>

               <p class="para"><b>7-Saturation:</b> Saturation is the intensity of a particular color. An image with color saturation as zero is a gray-scale image. Some digital cameras have a high contrast setting that increases the saturation of all colors in an image. This attribute can be used in Photoshop also. Some image viewers also allow this option.
               </p>  <br><br>


              <p class="para">Beside these, Aperture and Shutter-Speed combination is also very important for beautiful images.</p>
